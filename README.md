# 🎉 The Welfound Challenge

The following challenge shouldn't take more than a few hours to complete for someone brave enough and worthy to embark on 
this mission to developing the greatest Community Driven Recruitment platform.

We have setup almostg everything for you to resemble our current stack
- Prisma
- React Query
- Material UI
- Styled Components
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## 🎬 Getting Started

First clone this project on your local machine
```
git clone git@github.com/welfound-challenge.git
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### ❓ The Questions
To make sure you have pretty good understanding of React and some parts of the toolchain we would like you to answer
the following questions. Please provide your answer in the "arrays" 🤓 

```typescript
q[0] = 'What are some projects that you worked on recently and what were some of the challenges you had to overcome?';
a[0] = `

`;

a[2] = `

`;

q[3] = 'What are some benefits of using hooks?';
a[3] = `

`;

q[4] = 'What is props drilling and why it can become a problem? Can you specify ways to avoid it?';
a[4] = `

`;

q[5] = `How would you make sure that you don't over-fetching data from the server?`;
a[5] = `

`;

q[6] = 'What are the advantages of using TypeScript?';
a[6] = `

q[7] = 'What are TypeScript generics and when are you most likely to use them?';
a[7] = `

`;

q[8] = 'What is babel and why would one use it?';
a[8] = `

### 🎯 2 The Technical test:
Just to make sure that you are the right person to embark on our mission we'll make the test a bit (but not very)
challenging

Please make sure to create a branch out of `main` and push your work under that branch. You can name it however you want.
After you are finished with everything you can either create a single PR with all your work or multiple PRs. 
Totally up to you.

The only set-in-stone requirement is that you have to use TypeScript.


🧱 Then you will have to develop a small feature:
 
- [ ] Create a shortlist endpoint under `/api/v1/shortlist`
- [ ] Fetch the shortlist data from the database using the prisma client  
- [ ] Fetch the data from the mock endpoint using ReactQuery
- [ ] Create a **Shortlist Page** under the `/shortlist` route according to the "[design](docs/features/shortlist/shortlist.png)"
  
```    
 ℹ️ Don't worry we don't usually work out of PNG files 😄 We use Figma for our design files. 
    Design is really important to us but we care a lot more about solving the underling issues 
    in recruitment the industry. We will not be judging or expecting pixel perfect designs (yet😛)
    Oh and you might find `mui-datatables` handy to build the table 😉
```

⭐️ Bonus point and golden stars if you decide to do any (or all if you feel brave) the following optional tasks
 
- [ ] Create a custom error page.
- [ ] Create another route for fetching a single user (no need for the UI)
- [ ] Create a unit tests (it doesn't matter what library you're using are what are you testing)




⚠️ Please note that this technical test is private and not to be shared with anyone.
