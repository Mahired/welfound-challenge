# üéâ The Welfound Challenge

The following challenge shouldn't take more than a few hours to complete for someone brave enough and worthy to embark on 
this mission to developing the greatest Community Driven Recruitment platform.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## üé¨ Getting Started

First clone this project on your local machine
```
git clone git@github.com/welfound-challenge.git
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## üìöLearn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## üöÄ Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### ‚ùì The Questions

### üéØ 2 The Technical test:
Just to make sure that you are the right person to embark on our mission we'll make the test a bit (but not very)
challenging

Please make sure to create a branch out of `main` and push your work under that branch. You can name it however you want.
After you are finished with everything you can either create a single PR with all your work or multiple PRs. 
Totally up to you.

The only set-in-stone requirement is that you have to use TypeScript.


‚öôÔ∏è. You will have to do some platform work:

- [ ] Convert existing files to TypeScript.
- [ ] Setup NextConnect to handle API requests
- [ ] Setup MaterialUI Framwork
- [ ] Setup ReactQuery

üß± Then you will have to develop a small feature:

- [ ] Create a mock endpoint under `/api/v1/shortlist`
- [ ] Fetch the data from the mock endpoint using ReactQuery
- [ ] Create a **Shortlist Page** under the `/shortlist` route according to the "[design](docs/features/shortlist/shortlist.png)"
  
```    
 ‚ÑπÔ∏è Don't worry we don't usually work out of PNG files üòÑ We use Figma for our design files. 
    Design is really important to us but we care a lot more about solving the underling issues 
    in recruitment the industry. We will not be judging or expecting pixel perfect designs (yetüòõ)
    Oh and you might find `mui-datatables` handy to build the table üòâ
```

‚≠êÔ∏è Bonus point and golden stars if you decide to do any (or all if you feel brave) the following optional tasks
 
- [ ] Setup StyledComponents and create a small component make sure it works together with MaterialUI
- [ ] Create a custom error page.
- [ ] Create another route for fetching a single user (no need for the UI)
- [ ] Create a unit tests (it doesn't matter what library you're using are what are you testing)




‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that this technical test is private and not to be shared with anyone.
